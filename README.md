Full Cycle - Docker challenges

## Challenge 1 - Container GO

### Tips

This challenge is very exciting especially if you have never worked with the Go language!
You will have to publish an image to docker hub. When we run:

docker run <your-user>/full-cycle-rocks

We should have the following result: Full Cycle Rocks!

If you notice, this image just prints the message as a final result, so it's worth checking out the Go Lang website to learn how to make a "hello world".

Remembering that Go Lang has official images ready, it is worth checking the Docker Hub.

3. The image of our Go project needs to be less than 2MB =)

Tip: In the intro video about Docker when we talk about the layered file system, I present a "root" image, maybe it's a good one to use.
